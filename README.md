# Solving-1D-Schrodinger-Eqn
## The set of codes we wrote implementing a Explosion Minimization Method(that's how we name it !!) and Numerov's method

**Uday Sankar and Aniruddha Seal**

We have tested our code on:

1. Harmonic Oscillator
2. Double Well Potential
3. Morse Potential
4. Ammonia Inversion Potential
